# React Chat PWA

Fullstack PWA built with React Redux and Socket.io.

## What's cool about it:

- uses RTK Listener Middleware for listening to incoming messages
- uses Prisma ORM
- uses JWT for user authentication
- neatly wrapped in a docker container

wip!

## TBD:

- rewrite the backend to be less crappy
- implement express-session for the API and use it in the websocket server too
- make it look nice : )
- add proper workbox config
- add lots and lots of cool chat functionality
- add e2e testing on the front & api/unit testing on the back?
- deploy to heroku as an actual docker container?? ðŸ¤ª
